      <p>Graphic designers are problem solvers and their methods and processes are the tools they use to find solutions. This class is about deep exploration into our methods and processes as designers this semester.<br><br>
There is no right way to be a graphic designer. The key is to be open to any methods,forms and processes that are appropriate to the content and which communicate effectively. That being said, there are so many ways to communicate. We have to be sensitive to our audiences and allow ourselves time to experiment and play to find the right solution.<br><br>
We also must embrace the role that research, a particular kind of research, plays in the life of a designer. Form and content do not arise spontaneously, but draw upon diverse and open-minded engagements with source material. Design research of this kind is often akin to the practices of the collector, archivist and possibly even the hoarder. Developing a practice of collecting, archiving and using/reusing source materials will be very much a part of the work.

<div class="accordionHighlight">Due Next Class (Thursday, Jan 19th)</div>
<div class="accordionDrop">
      <p>Identify 5 keywords that will stick with your <mark>Make-A-Day</mark> project throughout the semester. These keywords are something that you're interested with or are part of you or are simply streams of consciousness that you've been thinking for quite a while. Keywords are important in identifying the main subjects apparent in your work and are critical in determining how relevant a piece of content is to related to your daily experimentation. Keywords should be in their basic form (e.g. singular nouns or infinitive verbs). Be as specific as possible; avoid more general words (e.g. Rather than "fashion", try to find related words that describe the element of fashion that you're interested in: "creases", "folds", or "silhouettes". Rather than "computer", try "harddisk", "printed circuit board", or "90s screensavers"). Be prepared to discuss your keywords to your group.</p>

              ⨂ Class overview.<br>
              ⨂ In a 1500 by 1500 pixel file, using only Illustrator tools and limited to black and white, draw a self-portrait. You can only use your mouse/mousepad (using drawing stylus is forbidden). <i>Avoid making a photorealistic line drawing of yourself/your friend through tracing.</i> Instead, try to draw them based on your own aesthetic sensibility and try to incorporate Illustrator effects into the drawing. Aim for unexpected discovery of Illustrator's tools, because the less you know about Illustrator, the better the outcome. After you finish with them, export them as .png or .jpg and then send it to anggarah@vcu.edu.<br>
              ⨂ Introduce <mark>Make-A-Day</mark> project. You will be responsible for establishing a daily practice focused on exploring and developing a healthy ritual of making. You will document this daily, generative process on your blog (document them on a new Instagram, Tumblr, or Are.na account), created specifically for this course. Use this as a space to explore and play with making. Use it to interrogate what making can mean. Making can sometimes feel like a whirlwind—try to document your work as you are making and build a catalogue of process for your future self to uncover later. Post the many possible iterations that you are working through—not just the final version. Email me the link to the Instagram/Tumblr/Are.na by the end of today.<br>
              ⨂ Some examples that somehow tangentially related to this project: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222205613/https://snackmountain.com/index.php?/print/-lauren/" target="_blank">Lauren Adolfsen</a> took pictures with people she had never met before; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140217012111/http://www.astasiototal.com/100_smiles/index_all.php5" target="_blank">Juan Astasio</a> artificially constructed "smiles" (also known as pareidolia) every day; <a href="https://hillakatki.info/One-Chair-100-Ways" target="_blank">Hilla Katki</a> photographed herself using a chair in different ways; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2DLNLTTjvM" target="_blank">Ely Kim</a> filmed himself dancing in a different place for 100 days; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816064848/https://jessicasvendsen.com/100-Days-with-Josef-Muller-Brockmann" target="_blank">Jessica Svendsen</a> redesigned a canonical Josef Müller-Brockmann poster according to four criteria: line, circle, movement, and sound.

⨀ Identify 5 keywords that will stick with your <mark>Make-A-Day</mark> project throughout the semester. These keywords are something that you're interested with or are part of you or are simply streams of consciousness that you've been thinking for quite a while. Keywords are important in identifying the main subjects apparent in your work and are critical in determining how relevant a piece of content is to related to your daily experimentation. Keywords should be in their basic form (e.g. singular nouns or infinitive verbs).

              ⨂ The class will be split into 3 small groups. Share your <mark>Make-A-Day</mark> blogs to your assigned group. Describe each entry and how you did them to your peers. Contrast and compare. What are the interesting approaches/methods/materials that you've encountered? What did you enjoy doing the most? Anything unexpected?<br>
              ⨂ Introduce Paul Thek's <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a5DS_uxB4yrxsHYmHROPLE6cRuY6aJkG/view" target="_blank">Teaching Notes: 4-Dimensional Design</a>.<br>
              ⨂ Start working on <mark>Thek Responses</mark>. Create 5 visual responses to any of the prompts from #1-52 entries in Thek’s “Teaching Notes.” One response per prompt. What you do for these first 5 may be used, refined, redone, or discarded in a final, longer series assigned next class. Decide on a visual methodology of documentation that best reveals the qualities within the experimentation that you are interested in. This will vary depending on your works, but here are some means you might consider: xeroxing to highlight shape and contour, scanning (enlarging?) to reveal very precise detail, making a rubbing to emphasize texture, or using a camera if your object is large and/or environmental.<br>
              ⨂ Things to consider: These are sketches, these are not precious, and follow your impulses.<br><br>
              ⨀ Work day in-class. Continue working on the <mark>Thek Responses</mark> until you have 20 visual responses for different prompt.

            <p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
            <div class="left">
              The departmental faculty have drafted a revised attendance policy, carefully considering the challenges and realities of holding classes in different spaces and in fractured time frames.<br><br>
              The standard VCU attendance policy states that student absences during the semester are not expected to exceed the number of times the class meets in one week. Our department has adopted a revised policy that addresses larger issues of
              expected engagement in a course. Consistent engagement is a vital component of successful completion of course objectives. The progression of this course requires all participants to be present and actively engaged in class, both during
              synchronous on-screen meetings, in person, and with asynchronous activities. Consistency of engagement is vital for successful completion of the course objectives. Each of us carries different circumstances and capacities; we are
              accountable for our own agency. This is always true, but especially crucial now. We are a community.<br><br>

              Be present for this class; participate consistently in the regular give-and-take of the classroom environment; be willing to share thoughts and experiences, as well as willing to actively listen to the thoughts and experiences of
              others.<br><br>

              Asynchronous engagement is equally important for your success in this course. If at any point during the semester you are unable to be present, communicate this clearly with me in a timely manner. Think about the manners in which you
              feel you will be able to be fully present and active with your community—this may differ from how others respond.<br><br>

              This class operates on the principle of charity, respect, and good faith. The responsibility to uphold and bolster these principles falls equally on all members of the class. Active listening is as important as active participation,
              please be gracious and generous with both. Connecting with peers is encouraged but does not substitute for communicating with the instructor directly. Contact me as soon as possible prior to, or after you miss a class. It is your
              responsibility to make-up for missing work.

            <div class="left">You will receive ongoing feedback on your work in group critiques and individual critiques with me. Projects and performance in this course will be evaluated with respect to three primary dimensions:<br><br>

              ⨁ <u>Participation:</u> your overall conduct throughout the duration of the project as you engage with the project and with your peers. Attendance, meeting deadlines, and being prepared for class will also be accounted for.<br>

              ⨁ <u>Process:</u> strength of your personal methodology and practice; idea generation and exploration; self evaluation; overall rigor in your approach to the project; articulation and presentation of your work; criticality.<br>

              ⨁ <u>Execution:</u> the quality of your ideas; craft; clarity of organization and presentation, how your materials (paper choice, imagery, typography, etc) connect to your concept.
